          KikainekoMocker is a tool which generates simulated-classes from test codes 
          under the concept of SCT (Simulated-Class by Tests).  
          KikainekoMocker reads JUnit Test Cases, and generated 
          simulated-classes that pass the test.

          <div class="desc">
          When developing classes that has dependency with unimplemented classes 
          or the environment, it is common to use "Simulated-Classes". 
          "Simulated-Classes" are "classes that behave in the same way as the real 
          class, but the implementation is not correct" 
          (also known as mocks, stubs, or drivers).
          With the  use of simulated-classes, development and testing of 
          such classes is performed.<br/><br/>
          Though the use of simulated-classes is effective, it is difficult to develop 
          the simulated-class itself, and it takes work.  
          To deal with this problem, many simulated-class generation tools are provided, 
          but the tools themselves have the following problems.
          <ul>
          <li>It is difficult to define the simulated-class 
          (Use of the tool's own unique API)</li>
          <li>At the end, the definition code for the simulated-class is thrown away</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <img src="img/mocktools.jpg">
          <br/>
          For example, as seen in the diagram above, when class A has dependency with 
          class B, and class B is unimplemented at the time of implementation or testing 
          of class A, it is common to apply simulated-classes.
          The use of simulated-class generation tools to reduce workload of 
          creating such classes can be presumued.  But conventionally, 
          there is a need to use the original API provided by the tool 
          to define the simulated-class.<br/>
          In addition, the definition code for the simulated-class 
          is not used for other than to generating the class, so the definition code 
          is thrown away after the simulation-class has been replaced with the real one.
          Therefore, excess cost is payed to create simulated-classes. <br/>
          <br/><br/>
          SCT is a concept where the test code for a class is interpreted as
          the defintion of I/O for the class itself, and simulated-classes are 
          generated from such definition codes, namely the test codes.<br/>
          Information of external behavior of a class is include in test codes.  SCT 
          uses this information and generates simulated-classes.<br/><br/>
          As shown in the diagram below, since SCT apprehends the test code as the 
          definition code for the simulated-class, there is no need for learning the
          tool's own unique API.  Also, when the simulated-class is replace with the 
          real class, the definition code itself is the code for testing, and is not 
          thrown away.  Therefore, the test code is effectively used.
          <br/><br/>

          KikainekoMocker reads JUnit test codes and generates simulated-classes, 
          under the concept of SCT.  By using the commonly used xUnit testing 
          framework, creating test codes are relatively simple, and it is posible 
          to intuitively define simulated-classes.  
          With JUnit, which is highly recognized, as the definition code, cost of 
          studying the definition code for the simulated-class can be reduced. <br/>
          KikainekoMocker is a tool that implements the concept of SCT.  By 
          analyzing JUnit test codes, simulated-classes that pass the test 
          code are generated.
