          <div class="desc">
            <p>
            When this kind of problem occurs, the cause can be thought as either of the following:<br/>
            a problem with the plugin, or a problem in writing the test case
            </p>
            <p>
            <font color="blue"><b>* A problem in writing the test case</b></font><br/>
            With writing test cases, please refer to the <a href="userguide.html">KikainekoMocker's Constraints</a> and correct the code.  When writing the test case in a inproper format, an exception occurs, and the process is aborted.<br/>
            Also, please check if KikainekoMocker is executed without saving the test case file.<br/>
            <br/>
            <font color="blue"><b>* A problem with the plugin</b></font><br/>
            When there is a problem with the plugin, the cause is often failure of installation.<br/>
            Please refer and try <a href="#install">Dealing with Installation Problems</a>.

        <h3>The result of executing the test case is still <span class="orange">r</span>ed, <br/>using the pseudo-class generated by KikainekoMocker!</h3>
          <div class="desc">
            <p>
            This is often caused by the JUnit's assertEquals() implementation.  <br/>
            Also, it can be caused when KikainekoMocker could not correctly generate the pseudo-class.<br/>
            In addition, it can be caused when the generated code is not properly reflected to Eclipse.
            </p>
            <p>
            <font color="blue"><b>* JUnit's assertEquals()</b></font><br/>
            When JUnit's assertEquals() implementation is the cause, this means that the pseudo-class generated by KikainekoMocker, correctly operates, but the fails to pass the test case.<br/>
            This occurs when Object type of data is given to the assertEquals() method.  
            With the default assertEquals() implementation, when Object types are set as arguments, 
            it simply calls the Object's equals() method.  
            The default equals() implementation just compares the hashCode, 
            so if this method is not overrided, it often fails to pass the test case.<br/>
            This can not be avoided.  Either the test case must be rewritten, or the equals() method must be overwritten.  <br/>
            But KikainekoMocker generates the pseudo-class without any problems, so you can use the pseudo-class even though the test result is red.
            </p>
            <p>
            <font color="blue"><b>* KikainekoMocker</b></font><br/>
            In rare cases, KikainekoMocker generated incorrect code without infroming any errors.<br/>
            This occurs when the test case is written in an inproper format.  
            In most cases KikainekoMocker informs you that you have written the test case in a forbidden format, 
            but in rare cases, it passes the parsing process without any errors.  
            This is because KikainekoMocker does not perfrom strict validation ensuring code generation speed.

            When failing to install, it is mostly because the reference to the old version of KikainekoMocker is left.<br/>

            When nothing works even though you tried everything on this page, it is probabaly a bug

            In this csae, please contact us through the <a href="https://www.seasar.org/mailman/listinfo/kikainekomocker">Mailing List</a>, or through the KikainekoMocker Developer's <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kikaineko">Blog</a>.

            <p>
            And in this case, until the problem is resolved, please avoid using KikainekoMocker throught the Eclipse plugin, and use it throught the <a href="userguide.html#TextUI">Text User Interface</a>.
