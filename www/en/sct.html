        <h1>Pseudo-Classes and <span id="orange">S</span>CT</h1>
          <div class="desc">
            <p>
            When developing classes that has dependency with unimplemented classes 
            or the environment, it is common to use "Pseudo-Classes". 
            "Pseudo-Classes" are "classes that behave in the same way as the real 
            class, but the implementation is not correct" 
            (also known as mocks, stubs, or drivers).
            With the  use of pseudo-classes, development and testing of 
            such classes is performed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Though the use of pseudo-classes is effective, it is difficult to develop 
            the pseudo-class itself, and it takes work.  
            To deal with this problem, many pseudo-class generation tools are provided, 
            but the tools themselves have the following problems.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>It is difficult to define the pseudo-class 
          (Use of the tool's own unique API)</li>
            <li>At the end, the definition code for the pseudo-class is thrown away</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="img/mocktools.jpg"></p>
            <p>
            For example, as seen in the diagram above, when class A has dependency with 
            class B, and class B is unimplemented at the time of implementation or testing 
            of class A, it is common to apply pseudo-classes.
            The use of pseudo-class generation tools to reduce workload of 
            creating such classes can be presumued.  But conventionally, 
            there is a need to use the original API provided by the tool 
            to define the pseudo-class.<br/>
            In addition, the definition code for the pseudo-class 
            is not used for other than to generating the class, so the definition code 
            is thrown away after the simulation-class has been replaced with the real one.
            Therefore, excess cost is payed to create pseudo-classes. 
            </p>
            <p>
            SCT is a concept where the test code for a class is interpreted as
            the defintion of I/O for the class itself, and pseudo-classes are 
            generated from such definition codes, namely the test codes.<br/>
            Information of external behavior of a class is include in test codes.  SCT 
            uses this information and generates pseudo-classes.
            </p>
            <p>
            As shown in the diagram below, since SCT apprehends the test code as the 
            definition code for the pseudo-class, there is no need for learning the
            tool's own unique API.  Also, when the pseudo-class is replace with the 
            real class, the definition code itself is the code for testing, and is not 
            thrown away.  Therefore, the test code is effectively used.
            </p>

            KikainekoMocker reads JUnit test codes and generates pseudo-classes, 
            under the concept of SCT.  By using the commonly used xUnit testing 
            framework, creating test codes are relatively simple, and it is posible 
            to intuitively define pseudo-classes.  
            With JUnit, which is highly recognized, as the definition code, cost of 
            studying the definition code for the pseudo-class can be reduced. <br/>
            KikainekoMocker is a tool that implements the concept of SCT.  By 
            analyzing JUnit test codes, pseudo-classes that pass the test 
            code are generated.
